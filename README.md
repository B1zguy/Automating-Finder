# Automating-Finder
 
Wanted a way to quickly create and manage tabs in Finder windows. Opening a set of directories each time I want to work on something is cumbersome so end-up leaving the tabs open, organised in sets of windows. Consequently over time (esp for long term and sporadic work) this becomes cluttered.

Using bookmarks in the sidebar is not ideal for projects I occassionally work on, additionally one still needs to individually open the tabs and arrange/organise them in windows.

The tabs in my Finder windows are grouped and specific to the project/s being worked on. 

I got the tab automation going yet found that I needed to roll out an unerlying solution for easily managing the tabs (ie. some sorta db or file to manage states). The goal was to get better with Applescript so left the project at this state.

Deploying these scripts involved utilitising other programs used.

## Open New Window with Set of Tabs
Opens a list of tabs in a new Finder window. Directories currently supplied within the script.

## Save Groups of Tabs
Collects currently open tabs of a window so that can be saved to list.
